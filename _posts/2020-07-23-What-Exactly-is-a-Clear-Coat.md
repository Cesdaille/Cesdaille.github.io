What exactly is a clear coat or top coat? Do all cars have it, or do I have to have someone apply it?

<p>
So, let us start from the top.
</p>

<p>
Allow me to explain. A clear coat is a paint or resin that is applied over your vehicle after the primary paint color is applied during the vehicle’s manufacturing process. The main purpose of this clear coat application is to seal in the primary paint color, maintain its high gloss, and act as a layer of protection; it does not contain any additional pigment. This application provides additional benefits besides maintaining gloss. Naturally over time, as vehicles are exposed to the elements; the clear coat begins to degrade as it protects from UV damage, shallow defects from light scratches, and chemical fallout, like acid rain. The coating serves its purpose as a sacrificial layer, which can then be removed through a paint correction and polishing process that restores the paints original color and luster.

Although a clear coat is very durable, negligence will accelerate the speed in which it begins to breakdown and oxidize. If you are concerned about maintaining your vehicle’s clear coat to make sure it stays in excellent condition, the best solution is to protect your vehicle from the elements as much as possible by keeping it under a covered area or in a garage. Additionally, organize a schedule to routinely have it washed. Preferably, by a professional who will strategically implement a wash process that greatly reduces the amount of fine scratches and swirls that unavoidably come from rubbing the vehicle’s surface with a wash product. They will also remove any chemical and physical contaminants from the vehicle surface that consumer-grade products are not able to. Lastly, depending on the vehicle’s level of use, and the climate in which you live. Routinely apply an additional sealant or protectant that will reinforce the factory clear coat, essentially doubling the level of the protection. There are multiple varieties to choose from available today; waxes, spray on’s, sealants, and arguably the most durable, ceramic coatings. Do your own research or speak to a professional auto detailer to discuss the options and see which would best serve your vehicle.
