<h1 class="post-title" >Auto Detailing vs Drive Up Car Wash </h1>

<p>
  With the recent popularity spike of auto detailing, many new car lovers and enthusiasts are beginning to understand the differences and benefits of having their vehicle professionally detailed, opposed to taking it to their regular drive up car wash. With that being said, I’d like to layout and explain a few of the key points that make a professional detailing service different from your generic car wash. 
</p>

<p>
On a surface level, both processes for cleaning your vehicle are not drastically different. Although, when they are compared by their individual parts, the differences are quite refined; overall leading to a massive difference.
</p>

<h2 class="post-subheading">Time</h2>
<p>
  Arguably the most significant factor leading to the quality difference of the wash is time. The drive up car wash business model was designed to save time. Profits were made on numbers, the more cars served, the more money was made for the business. For many busy individuals, this convenience beat out other considering factors and became the winner. On the other hand, auto detailing was seen as a hobby for the car enthusiast, and those who had the spare hours to spend on maintaining their vehicle in perfect condition.
</p>

<h2 class="post-subheading">Quality of Service</h2>
<p>
  With both business models operating on drastically different goals (speed of service and affordability), it’s clear that there must be some type of, “give and take” involved to effectively meet these goals. A car wash has to have a certain number of vehicles serviced to see success in profitability. In an effort to reach this goal, they typically slim down their service offerings to minimize customer thought processing and keep services quick; while also decreasing the amount and quality of products used. This take allows them to give a more convenient service that suits the busy individual. On the other hand, an auto detailer is the bespoke tailored suit, to their “rent a tux”. A professional auto detailing service will see a fraction of the clients so they can use the extra time for accessing the client’s vehicle and understand how it’s used and cared for so they can put together a custom service that addresses the vehicles specific needs. This translates to higher quality products, tools, and techniques to clean, correct, and protect the vehicle, leaving the client with an incomparable difference many have never experienced before, unfortunately.

<h2 class="post-subheading">Long Term Effect on Vehicle</h2>
<p>
  For lack of a better expression, you get what you put in. The same is true for how your vehicle is washed and maintained. Over time a drive up car wash will lead to a vehicle that looks dull and lost most of the luster is had when driving it off the lot. This comes from low-quality products, cheap equipment, and a lack of detail that provide a time and cost-effective solution to the busy individual. However, having your vehicle serviced by a professional auto detailing service that only uses high-quality products, equipment, and loves inspecting vehicles with a fine comb, will undoubtedly result in your vehicle looking like it was purchased yesterday.
</p>

<p>
  To be clear, there is no right or wrong answer on what the best option is, that question is relative to the individual. Do you see your vehicle as an investment which you want to maintain its value, do you obsess over the stunning color and gloss of your paint, or are you meticulously detailed and value not cutting corners? You may want to consider seeing what a quality auto detailing professional can do for your car.
