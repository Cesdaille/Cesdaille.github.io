<p class="surface-container about-text about-container">Auto detailing started as an early obsession of mine in Highschool. Learning everything about detailing
 and proper techniques was all I cared about so that I could keep my first car in its best condition. 
 From then on, I would always find myself looking at vehicles differtly, with an obessive eye for details. 
 Plus, always being asked to clean friends and family members cars because they couldn't belive the difference 
 that was made compared to a drive through car wash or poor hand washing techniques that most of us are currently
 familair with. Fast forward to today, I found myself contemplating unique skills that I could provide in effort
 to start my own small business. From hands on experience and past success, auto detailing was the clear choice, 
 and Gallery Detail is the product of said decision.

After many iterations and considering what other details offered. I put together a unique service offering that
benefits the client to the highest extent possible. In terms of exceeding client expectations and providing the best
vehicle maintance, Gallery Detail sees itself as an elite in auto detailing and I am confident you will agree.</p>
