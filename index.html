          The cleaned surface is then rid of any tar, iron fallout, and surface

          The vehicle is then wiped over with a clay bar, similar to molding

          The surface will receive one or multiple stages of abrasive compound

          The vehicles newly restored paint is then given a layer protection

          Ceramic coatings provide 12 months + of protection and makes future
          washes effortless due to the hydrophobic qualities that don't allow
