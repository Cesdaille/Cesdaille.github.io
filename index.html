  <div class="process-container surface-container">
    <p>
      Our approach to auto detailing is different than most. Operating under a
      monthly subscription model, allows us to ensure vehicles are routinely
      serviced. Never given the opportunity to sit with contaminants that would
      otherwise cause permanent damage to vehicle surfaces. To provide a
      personalized experience, our exclusive client list is kept small - granting extended
      service times and the flexibility to schedule at your convenience.
    </p>

    <br />

    <p>
      To guarantee consistency, all monthly packages start with our “restoration
      total detail”. This wash fully restores the interior and exterior of your
      vehicle - bringing it to Gallery Detail standards. Afterwards, we adjust
      our detailing process for follow up maintaince washes, prioritizing
      preservation and upkeep of your vehicle.

      have you covered!
